Project Title:
Predicting Customer Churn in a Subscription-Based Business Using Machine Learning

Background:
Customer retention is a critical concern for businesses operating under a subscription-based or service model. Losing customers — commonly referred to as customer churn — directly impacts revenue and growth. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, businesses can proactively engage them with targeted retention strategies, potentially saving millions in lost revenue.

Business Problem:
A leading telecom company has observed a consistent monthly churn rate that is affecting its profitability. The management wants to understand which customers are likely to churn and why. The goal is to use historical customer data to build a machine learning model that predicts churn with high accuracy, enabling the company to take preventive actions.

Project Objective:

To develop a machine learning pipeline that:

1. Predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (binary classification)

2. Identifies the most important factors influencing churn

3. Provides insights and recommendations to reduce future churn

Inputs:

1. Demographic data (e.g., gender, age group, senior citizen status)

2. Services subscribed (e.g., phone service, internet, streaming)

3. Account details (e.g., tenure, billing type, payment method)

4. Historical churn label (churned or retained)

Expected Outcomes:

1. A machine learning model capable of predicting churn with strong performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

2. Insights into top churn-driving features using interpretability techniques (e.g., feature importance, SHAP)

3. Business-level recommendations to enhance customer retention
